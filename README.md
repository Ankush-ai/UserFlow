UserFlow - User Management System
UserFlow is a user management system built using React.js as the front-end framework. It provides a user-friendly interface for efficiently managing user accounts and their data. The backend of UserFlow runs on a fake API using JSON Server, making it easy to simulate a server environment during development.

Features
User Management: Create, update, and delete user accounts with ease. Assign specific roles and permissions to users based on your organization's requirements.
User Authentication: Implement secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure only authorized access to the system.
User Search and Filtering: Quickly find and filter users based on various criteria such as name, email, or role.
User Analytics: Generate comprehensive reports and analytics to gain insights into user behavior, system usage, and performance.
User Onboarding and Offboarding: Automate the user onboarding and offboarding processes, making it seamless and efficient.
Technologies Used
React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a fast and responsive front-end experience.
JSON Server: A simple and lightweight mock API server that allows you to simulate a backend environment using JSON data.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, used for user authentication and authorization.
HTML5/CSS3: Markup and styling languages used for structuring and presenting the UserFlow web application.
Bootstrap: A CSS framework that provides a responsive and mobile-first design approach, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive user interface.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## 'npm run start-all'
this starts the front end react app along with the fake backend api using json server at the same port .ie. it runs tha app.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
